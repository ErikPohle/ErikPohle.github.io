## Linking Portfolio to Github

Generate a Github personal access token following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) (make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token).

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project, check the base file

Note: Instead of creating a .env file, you can just run this command "cp env.example .env" inside the root directory

```bash
- DeveloperFolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - env.example  <-- this is the base file
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your github token like this.

```javascript
 // .env
  REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
```

Set `showGithubProfile` to true or false to show Contact Profile using Github, defaults to false.

Note: Open Source Projects section only show pinned items of your Github.
If you are seeing something as shown below, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

#### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://developerfolio.js.org/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerFolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.

- In short you can also add `/devloperFolio` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly.

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
